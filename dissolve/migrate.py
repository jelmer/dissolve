"""Migration functionality for replacing deprecated function calls.

This module provides the core logic for analyzing Python source code,
identifying calls to functions decorated with @replace_me, and replacing
those calls with their suggested alternatives.

The migration process involves:
1. Parsing source code to find @replace_me decorated functions
2. Extracting replacement expressions from function bodies
3. Locating calls to deprecated functions
4. Substituting actual arguments into replacement expressions
5. Generating updated source code with perfect formatting preservation

Example:
    Given a source file with::

        @replace_me()
        def old_api(x, y):
            return new_api(x, y, mode="legacy")

        result = old_api(5, 10)

    The migration will transform it to::

        @replace_me()
        def old_api(x, y):
            return new_api(x, y, mode="legacy")

        result = new_api(5, 10, mode="legacy")
